# Project Name: Smart Task Manager

## Project Idea

A web-based task management system designed to help organizations manage and track employee tasks efficiently.
Admins can create, assign, and monitor tasks, while employees can view and update their progress in real-time.

The system is built using Spring Boot, secured with **JWT authentication**, and deployed using **Docker**, **Nginx**, and **Kubernetes**, with **Prometheus & Grafana** for system monitoring and performance tracking.

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

Metrics for project success (e.g., response time, system uptime, user adoption rate):

| **Metric**               | **Target**   | **Description**                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| System Uptime            | ≥ 99%        | Stability and availability of the deployed app |
| Average Response Time    | ≤ 500ms      | API performance and efficiency                 |
| Task Completion Accuracy | ≥ 95%        | Correct handling of task status updates        |
| User Adoption Rate       | ≥ 80%        | Percentage of users actively using the system  |
| Error Rate               | ≤ 2%         | Number of failed requests or exceptions        |
| Deployment Success Rate  | 100%         | Smooth deployment through Docker/Kubernetes    |
